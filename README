WWW-Scraper-Gmail version 0.01
==============================

This is a very simple interface into GMail.
It is based off of the code by Ilia Alshanetsky (http://ilia.ws)

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

NOTES
    This is my first perl module and was written quickly. There are bugs, and it is
    not done "correctly" I'm sure. If you have any suggestions, bug fixes, hate mail
    feel free to send it to kastner@gmail.com

    I hope somone finds this useful.

    you must have a file ~/.gmailrc. The format is as follows:
[gmail]
username=<username>
password=<password>

    you should chmod it 700 so it is not readable

FUNCTIONS

These are the functions in the Module, they may change, but it will be noted here
    fetchMail()
        Returns an array of hash refs of all msgs in inbox (read and unread)
            {
                from    => ,

                date    => ,
                blurb   => ,
                new     => 
            };
    outputMail()
        Spits out all unread mail from inbox in the format
            "$from$delim$subject$delim$time$delim$blurb\n";
        where $delim is either $ARGV[0] or ";;"
